# RobotController Application

## Overview
This project simulates a robot navigating a floor using commands entered via a command-line interface. The robot's state includes position, pen status (up/down), and direction (north, south, east, west). When the pen is down and the robot moves, the floor is marked with a trace. The project follows an iterative and incremental development approach and includes comprehensive testing, code analysis, and QA processes.
---

## Features
- Initialize a 2D floor of size *n x n*
- Control the robot's pen (up/down)
- Move the robot in the current direction
- Turn the robot left or right
- Display the robot's current status
- Print the marked floor
- View command history
- Quit the application

---

## Technologies Used
- Java 23
- Maven
- JUnit 5.3.1
- JaCoCo (for code coverage)
- PIT (for mutation testing)
- Eclipse / IntelliJ (IDE)
